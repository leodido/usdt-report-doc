# Changelog

## 1.1.0 - 2015-05-16

Dictionary names using underscores (e.g. `en_GB`) are now supported, thanks to
Tom Kadwill.

The Gem is now licensed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0 instead of the MIT
license. More information on this can be found at
<https://github.com/YorickPeterse/oga/commit/0a7242aed44fcd7ef18327cc5b10263fd9807a35>.

## 1.0.2 - 2014-11-13

The Speller class now checks if a dictionary is installed upon initialization or
when updating a speller (instead of just crashing). See
<https://github.com/YorickPeterse/ffi-aspell/pull/20> for more information.

## 1.0.1 - 2014-11-05

An alternative library name for Aspell was added so that this Gem now works on
Ubuntu systems.

## 1.0.0 - 2014-09-10

The first stable release of the Gem (at least according to semver). This release
contains a bunch of under the hood changes, a new project structure and a new
test suite.

The biggest change is that thanks to Chris Schmich
(<https://github.com/schmich>) ffi-aspell no longer leaks certain native
resources. A finalizer is used to clean up these resources but you can
explicitly free them by calling `close` on a speller object. See the following
issues/pull-requests for more information:

* <https://github.com/YorickPeterse/ffi-aspell/pull/15>
* <https://github.com/YorickPeterse/ffi-aspell/pull/16>
* <https://github.com/YorickPeterse/ffi-aspell/pull/17>

Another big change, and one of the reasons for the major version increase, is
the removal of support for Ruby 1.8.7. To be exact, ffi-aspell now requires Ruby
1.9.3 or newer. This simplifies some of the internal encoding handling and just
generally makes my life easier.
